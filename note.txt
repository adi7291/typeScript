1. npm install -g typescript // this will install typescript globally in the folder.
2. In bash check for tsc --v
3. The index.ts file never execute by using node index.ts 
4. First we need to compile the ts file to 'js' file and the index.js file will be created. 
5. tsc will compile all js file in the folder. tsc index.js will compile only index.ts file.
6. To automate the compilation and execution. npm install -g ts-node , create tsconfig file==>
    tsc --init.
7. In tsconfig.json file we can uncomment noEmmit for not compiling file if there is issue.
8. Now we can run ts-node index.ts which will execute the index.ts file 

let num:number=100
console.log(num)
num='ram' [Type String cannot be assignable to type number.]
